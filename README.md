# Learning C#

This repository is my initial exercise as I start learning C# as part of Training for Ctrl+ Future -Junior Back-end Developer.

## Description

In this exercise, I created a C# program that generates a list of even numbers from 2 to 100 and displays them in a specific format. The program calculates the sum of every five consecutive even numbers and displays the result in parentheses.
